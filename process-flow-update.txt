The Comprehensive Process Flow
This flow charts Marie's complete journey through the application, from entry to advanced use.

Authentication:

Marie opens the app and is presented with a secure, minimalist Login Page.

She successfully signs in with her credentials.

The Shared Library (Home Base):

Upon login, she lands on the Shared Library home screen, which is designed as a virtual bookshelf.

Her profile image is visible in the top-left corner, and a menu icon is available to access the side navigation.

The side navigation contains links to: Shared Library, Private AI Studio, Playbooks, and Profile.

The 'Intention-Setting' Choice:

Marie clicks on a JournalBook (e.g., "The Relationship Log").

A modal dialog appears, asking for her intention:

Option A: [Explore with AI]

Option B: [View]

Path A: Private AI Studio (Introspection & Creation):

Marie selects [Explore with AI].

She is navigated to the dedicated Private AI Studio for "The Relationship Log."

The UI is a modern chat interface. A sidebar shows her previous chat histories on this topic. A new chat is started.

The AI's personality and opening prompt are fine-tuned specifically for the "Relationship Log" topic.

She has a conversation with the AI, refining a thought.

She clicks an "Add to Shared Journal" button on a specific AI response.

A small pop-up appears: "Successfully added to shared journal." with two options: [View Journal] or [Dismiss].

She clicks [Dismiss] and continues her conversation in the Private Studio.

Path B: The Shared Sanctuary (Collaboration & Connection):

Later, Marie navigates back to the Shared Library. She clicks the "Relationship Log" book again and this time selects [View].

She is navigated to the Shared Sanctuary screen for that journal.

The UI is a side-by-side message view showing her entries and Aaron's entries chronologically.

She sees a new menu icon on the right-hand side. Clicking it slides out a Collaboration Panel.

Advanced Collaboration (Playbook Generation):

In the Collaboration Panel, she clicks [Playbook Suggestions].

The AI analyzes the journal and generates three dynamic, tailored buttons (e.g., "Write a fantasy scene," "Create a date night plan").

Marie clicks "Write a fantasy scene."

A full playbook is generated by the AI and appears in an editable text area within the panel.

She reviews and edits the text, then clicks [Save to Playbooks].

The Playbooks Archive (Review & Resonance):

Marie opens the main side navigation and clicks on Playbooks.

She is taken to the Playbooks Archive, where she sees a section titled "The Relationship Log."

Inside, she finds the "Fantasy Scene" playbook she just saved.

Next to the title are two heart iconsâ€”one for her, one for Aaron. She clicks her heart, and it fills in, indicating she has favorited it.

The Sandbox (Free-form Exploration):

At any time, Marie can open the side navigation and click on the "Your AI Assistant" link.

This takes her to a general-purpose AI chat interface, not tied to a specific journal topic.

The AI here has access to the entire "memory core" and can discuss any topic, allowing for free-form exploration and the potential generation of new journal topics in the future.

Action Plan to Achieve This Vision

Task 3: Implement the "Shared Library" (Home Screen): Design the JournalBook component and lay them out on the home page.

Task 4: Implement the 'Intention-Setting' Dialog: Create the modal dialog that appears when a JournalBook is clicked, with navigation logic for the "View" and "Explore with AI" buttons.

Phase 2: Build the Private AI Studio
Task 1: Create the Dedicated Studio Page: Build the dynamic page for the AI Studio (e.g., /studio/[topicId]).

Task 2: Design the Chat Interface: Create the main chat view, including the chat history sidebar.

Task 3: Implement Topic-Specific AI Prompts: Create a system to pass a tailored system prompt to the AI based on the topicId from the URL.

Task 4: Implement the "Add to Shared Journal" Workflow: Add the button to AI responses and create the "Toast/Sonner" pop-up with its "View Journal" and "Dismiss" actions.

Phase 3: Construct the Shared Sanctuary & Playbook Generator

Phase 4: Finalize the Playbooks Archive & AI Assistant
Task 1: Build the Playbooks Archive Page: Create the main /playbooks page with its accordion layout.
